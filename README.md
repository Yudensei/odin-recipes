# odin-recipes

Just a simple recipes webpage for The Odin Project fundamentals.

This page should use everything I learned in the HTML Foundations lessons, including:

- Do a HTML boilerplate

- Use elements such as <html></html>, <body></body>, <img>, etc.

- Use tags such as src="", href="", etc.

- Use and create a page with git.
